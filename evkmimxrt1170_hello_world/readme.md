# Info about how import the project

I'm not an MCUXpresso expert, so this is my way I found to import this project to the IDE:

Under the folder "workspace" create a folder "evkmimxrt1170_hello_world".

Inside this folder extract the two 7zip project. The result is show in the picture.

Now you can "Import" the project inside the IDE, pointing on the upper folder: "evkmimxrt1170_hello_world".
